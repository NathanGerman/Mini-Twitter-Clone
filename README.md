# Mini-Twitter-Clone

My name is Nathan and this is my very first mini twitter clone.

This code simulates a very basic social media app. It allows users to create an account with a username and bio. Users can write posts that are saved in a feed and viewed by everyone. Each post can receive likes from other users. A menu lets the user choose what action to take, such as creating users, posting, viewing the feed, or liking a post.
